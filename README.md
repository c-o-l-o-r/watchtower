Watchtower is a monitoring solution for [Plasma](https://medium.com/@argongroup/ethereum-plasma-explained-608720d3c60e) that is able to notify registered users of malicious activity occuring on the chain in real time.

*We built our project around [Plasma Group](https://plasma.group)'s implementation of Plasma Cash.*
